### SCHEMA-001: Database Schema Design

**Context:** Need a complete schema to support all Chrononaut features per PRD v3.

**Decision:** Created 14 tables with comprehensive RLS policies:
- Core: `profiles`, `notes`, `time_blocks`, `tasks`, `journal_entries`
- Health: `health_metrics`
- Meetings: `meeting_notes`
- AI: `ai_insights`, `cue_rules`, `cue_instances`
- System: `integration_tokens`, `audit_log`, `user_settings`, `notification_preferences`

**Rationale:**
- RLS policies ensure users only access their own data
- Audit log for security/debugging
- Separate tables for different data types (not one massive table)
- Indexes on commonly queried fields

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Security by default via RLS
- ⚠️ 14 tables may need consolidation later if too complex

### SCHEMA-002: Location Fields on Notes Table

**Context:** Quick capture workflow needs geolocation and photo upload for unified map view across journal entries and quick captures.

**Decision:** Added to `notes` table:
```sql
location_name text        -- freeform, e.g., "Salt Lake City, UT"
location_lat numeric(10,7) -- 7 decimal places = ~1cm precision
location_lng numeric(10,7)
photo_url text
```

**Rationale:**
- Enables unified map view across `journal_entries` and `notes`
- Freeform `location_name` + lat/lng is more flexible than structured city/state/country
- Can parse via reverse geocoding API when saving if structured data needed later

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Map view can query both tables
- ✅ Flexible for international locations
- ⚠️ May need geocoding API integration later

---

### INFRA-001: Disable cacheComponents

**Context:** Next.js 16 Vercel template includes `cacheComponents: true` which is an experimental feature.

**Decision:** Disabled `cacheComponents` in `next.config.ts`.

**Rationale:**
- `cacheComponents` conflicts with dynamic auth routes
- Causes build errors: "Uncached data accessed outside Suspense"
- Can't use `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` with cacheComponents
- Auth routes inherently need dynamic rendering (checking session)

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ Auth routes work correctly
- ⚠️ May miss some caching benefits (minor for MVP)
- 📝 Can re-enable later when Next.js 16 patterns are more established

### DESIGN-001: Warm Color Palette for Neurodivergent UX

**Context:** Need a calming, low-cognitive-load design that feels warm and inviting, not corporate.

**Decision:** Adopted warm palette:
- **Forest Green:** #2D5A47 (primary actions, active states)
- **Mustard Gold:** #D4A84B (accents, highlights)
- **Cream:** #FDFBF7, #F5F0E6, #E8DCC4 (backgrounds, cards)
- **Muted Green:** #5C7A6B, #8B9A8F (secondary text)

**Font:** Lora (serif) for headings, Geist Sans for body.

**Rationale:**
- Avoids harsh colors (purples, reds, bright blues) that can be overstimulating
- Warm cream backgrounds reduce eye strain
- Serif headings feel elegant and calm
- Nautical theme (Chrononaut = time traveler) reflected in compass logo

**Design Inspirations:**
- Notion (clean hierarchy)
- Insight Timer (calming palette)
- Tend Dental (friendly, not corporate)

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Visually calming for ADHD/autistic users
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ Distinctive brand identity
- ⚠️ Need to ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility (will test)
